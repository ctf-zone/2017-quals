We suspect that one of the candidates plans to bribe people in order to get more votes. We have intercepted a part of his correspondence but, unfortunately, all messages are encrypted. Our man from this election campaign has informed us that they use MPRSA cryptosystem for secure communication.

* Cryptosystem in use: [mprsa.py](mprsa.py)
* Candidate public data: [public.txt](public.txt)
* Encrypted message: [data.enc](data.enc)
